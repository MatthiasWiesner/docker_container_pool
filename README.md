# docker_container_pool

A docker-wrapper tool to handle docker container groups. 
A docker container group is here a group of same docker containers, that share the same settings.
So, **this is not a docker swarm** (which is a cluster of docker hosts)

This tool provides a RESTlike interface to start, stop or delete containers.

Look at te unittests and functionaltests for detailed info...
